To start a project 
1. Run command **"npm run all-install && npm run build"**
2. Run command **"npm run dev"**

Then always to start a project during development use **"npm run dev"**

To check you code run **"npm run lint"**
Also we have lint on precommit, so you can't commit your code without 
fixing all errors
